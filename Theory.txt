Rules for Generic Classes:
Declaration:

To declare a generic class, you use angle brackets (<>) with one or more type parameters. For example: class Box<T> {...}.
Type Parameter Naming:

By convention, single uppercase letters like T, U, V, etc., are often used as type parameters. However, you can use any valid identifier.
Instantiation:

When creating an instance of a generic class, you provide the actual type arguments. For example: Box<Integer> intBox = new Box<>(42);.
Type Inference:

In many cases, the compiler can infer the type arguments based on the provided arguments and context, reducing the need to explicitly specify them.
Generic Methods:

In addition to generic classes, Java supports generic methods. You can declare a method with its own set of type parameters.


Benefits of Generic Classes:
Type Safety:

Generics provide compile-time type checking, reducing the chance of runtime type errors. The compiler ensures that you only use the correct types with generic instances.
Code Reusability:

Generic classes and methods enable you to write code that can work with different types, promoting code reusability. You can create components that work for various data types without duplicating code.
Elimination of Type Casting:

With generics, you can avoid explicit type casting because the type information is preserved. This leads to cleaner and more readable code.
Algorithm Abstraction:

Generics allow you to create algorithms and data structures that are independent of the specific types they operate on. For example, a generic sorting algorithm can be used for sorting arrays of different types.
Improved Code Maintainability:

Code that uses generics tends to be more readable and maintainable. You can write more general-purpose code that expresses its intentions clearly.
Enhanced API Design:

Generics are commonly used in designing APIs to provide flexibility and express the intended use of methods or classes.
Performance:

Generics in Java use type erasure at runtime, meaning that the generic type information is removed, and the code works with raw types. This allows for backward compatibility with non-generic code and avoids introducing performance overhead.
Error Detection:

Errors related to type mismatch or misuse are caught at compile time rather than runtime, making it easier to identify and fix issues early in the development process.
